Created a fully responsive website from scratch using Bootstrap 5 for a fictional brand, Kelp Shake, inspired by SpongeBob. The project includes dynamic components like a carousel, dropdown menus, and custom-designed cards. Leveraging Bootstrap utilities and custom CSS, the website showcases a modern, user-friendly design.
